# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

## General Idea
Human history on a blockchain - transactions contain details of events that have happened, if other nodes independently verify it then it is added to our shared record. Facts only, such as date, time, simple description of what happened.

Example Workflow
1. Users submit, time, date, factual description of events
2. This is independently verified by other nodes and added to the blockchain
3. Users can query the blockchain for unbiased information about some event, day
